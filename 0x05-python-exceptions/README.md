0x05 Python - Exceptions üêç
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's often used as a ‚Äúscripting language‚Äù for web applications. This means that it can automate specific series of tasks, making it more efficient. This project covers exceptions

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

What‚Äôs the difference between errors and exceptions
What are exceptions and how to use them
When do we need to use exceptions
How to correctly handle an exception
What‚Äôs the purpose of catching exceptions
How to raise a builtin exception
When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception
Tasks ‚úîÔ∏è
Function that prints x elements of a list.
Function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
Function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
Function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
Function that divides element by element 2 lists.
Function that raises a type exception.
Function that raises a name exception with a message.
Function that prints an integer.
Function that executes a function safely.
Function def magic_calculation(a, b):
Three C functions that print some basic info about Python lists, Python bytes an Python float objects. (Pending task)
